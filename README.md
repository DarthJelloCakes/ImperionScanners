ImperionScanners
================

Small scripts used in Imperion for a while now. I do not know the original creators of the script (Not english from the old display languange). I have only just patched them up to display better and a few glitches that come up every now and then. Compatibility has been an issue too, so please make sure you have javascript enabled. You'll also need either codemonkey/tampermonkey or another script running app installed to run them on Imperion.
